# Iona

Unity exercise. This is a simple setup for a spaceship game with full
navigation control. Creating this setup has given me a better
understanding of Unity's new Input System as well as the Cinemachine tool.
I also had the chance to challenge my 3D physics and object/asset handling
skills.

Working on this project has proven to be a very worthwhile endeavor, I
look forward to further honing my Unity skills with more exercises like
this one.
